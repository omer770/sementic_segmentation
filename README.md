Making deep learning sementic segmentation 

The process of linking each pixel in an image to a class label is referred to as semantic segmentation. The label could be, for example, cat, flower, lion etc. Semantic segmentation can be thought of as image classification at pixel level. Therefore, in semantic segmentation, every pixel of the image has to be associated with a certain class label.
